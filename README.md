# VimCheatsheet

VimCheatsheet (Interactive) is a web application based on Angular, which aims to provide you with a broad overview of the functionalities in VIM.
It is built around the representation of a classic keyboard layout with the corresponding VIM key mappings. However, the possibilities are limitless.
By categorizing all key mappings into different experience levels, organizing all functions, implementing a layer concept, and offering a VIM gameplay mode, the application can elevate your understanding of VIM to the next level.
